# Space Invaders
A classic arcade-style space shooting game built using Pygame. In this game, you control a yellow spaceship and must defend yourself against waves of alien invaders. Shoot down enemies, avoid their lasers, and try to survive as long as possible!

# Game Features
1. Player Spaceship: Control a yellow spaceship and shoot lasers at enemies.
2. Enemy Waves: Enemies come in three colors: red, green, and blue, each with its own ship and laser.
3. Health and Lives: The player has health and lives; the game ends when both are depleted.
4. Levels: Progress through levels by defeating waves of enemies. Each new level increases the difficulty with more enemies.
5. Game Over: If your health or lives reach zero, the game will end, and a "You lost!!" message will appear.

# Controls

2. Move Right: D key
